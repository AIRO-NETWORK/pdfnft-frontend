# PDFNFT Dapp

Welcome to the PDFNFT Dapp repository! This project is an integral part of the AIRO Network's initiatives, introducing an innovative platform designed to transform regular PDF documents into secure and monetizable Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). PDFNFT offers a novel approach to preserving and monetizing important documents while actively participating in environmental sustainability.

## Summary

The PDFNFT project offers the following key features:

1. **Upload and Storage**: Users can easily upload their PDF documents, including a cover image, by paying a nominal fee. These documents are securely stored in a redundant environment, including the cloud and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), ensuring their long-term preservation.

2. **Monetization**: Uploaded PDF documents become available on the Itheum data marketplace, allowing users to retain control over pricing and distribution. Blockchain technology verifies document security and authenticity, enhancing their appeal to potential buyers.

3. **Environmental Impact**: PDFNFT is committed to environmental sustainability. For every document converted into an NFT through PDFNFT, a tree is planted, aligning with AIRO's broader sustainability vision and making a tangible, non-fungible difference to the planet.

4. **AIRO Credits**: Users can use AIRO Credits as a payment method on the PDFNFT platform. Notably, 20% of all fiat profits generated by PDFNFT.com are reinvested to purchase AIRO Credits from the open market, contributing to the sustainability of AIRO's ecosystem.

## Technical Insights

### Technology Stack

The PDFNFT Dapp is built using a modern technology stack, combining front-end and blockchain technologies:

- **React**: The front-end of the Dapp is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a responsive and interactive user experience.

- **Redux**: Redux is used for state management in the application. It helps manage complex application state and enables efficient data flow.

- **Tailwind CSS**: The styling of the Dapp is handled by Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for easy customization and maintainability.

- **Web3.js**: Web3.js is employed to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It enables the Dapp to connect to smart contracts, manage user wallets, and perform blockchain operations.

- **IPFS (Interplanetary File System)**: PDF documents are securely stored using IPFS, a distributed peer-to-peer file system that ensures data redundancy and availability.

- **NFT.Storage**: NFT.Storage is used to store NFT data off-chain. It's a popular solution for storing NFT metadata while preserving decentralization.

### Blockchain Integration

The PDFNFT Dapp leverages blockchain technology in several key ways:

- **Smart Contracts**: The Dapp interacts with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to create, manage, and transfer PDFNFTs. These contracts ensure the security and authenticity of NFTs.

- **Wallet Integration**: Users can connect their Ethereum wallets to the Dapp to manage their PDFNFTs and perform transactions securely.

- **Decentralization**: The blockchain ensures the decentralization of NFT ownership and transactions, providing users with full control over their assets.

### Development Environment

The Dapp's development environment includes the following tools:

- **Yarn**: Yarn is used for package management. It helps manage project dependencies efficiently.

- **Webpack**: Webpack is configured to bundle and optimize the project's assets for production deployment.

- **TypeScript**: The project is written in TypeScript, providing strong typing and enhanced developer tooling.

- **Linting**: ESLint is used for code linting to maintain code quality and consistency.

- **Testing**: The Dapp includes test scripts to verify the functionality and stability of the application.

### Folder Structure

The project has the following folder structure:

- `public`: Contains public assets and the HTML template.
- `src`: Contains the source code for the PDFNFT Dapp.
  - `components`: Reusable components used in the app.
  - `pages`: Individual pages of the app.
  - `reducers`: Redux reducers for state management.
  - `utils`: Utility functions.
  - ...
